### Minecraft: Pumpkin
Just take the pumpkin off your head, that should be easy task rigth?

The challenge does not require a Minecraft premium (paid) account as the server is running in offline-mode.

Server runs on version 1.20.1 for your convenience as there are more tools available for this version. 
To view server code you can use one of the deobfuscators/name remappers:

- [MCP-Reborn](https://github.com/Hexeption/MCP-Reborn)

Other useful resources:

If your team doesn't have a Minecraft premium account (which is not required) but you are confident it can give you advantage, please make a ticket.
