You have to help. The year is 1886, and the Wild West is booming with opportunity. Towns spring up overnight, driven by gold rushes, cattle drives, and, most recently, a string of casinos promising fortunes to anyone daring enough to try their luck. These establishments, from the bustling streets of Deadwood to the dusty corners of Tombstone, seem to have made a critical error in their game designs. The odds are shockingly favorable to the players. In fact, the expected outcomes are positive, meaning folks have a better chance of winning than losing.

But there's more to this story than meets the eye. Some say the casino owners, usually shrewd and calculating, couldn't have made such a blunder. Rumors spread that these so-called "mistakes" might have more sinister roots. Perhaps the casinos are part of a bigger scheme, aiming to lure people in with easy wins before revealing a darker plot. Your task is to navigate through these perilous waters and ensure the townspeople can capitalize on this opportunity without falling into any traps.

As you travel from town to town, your goal is to help the locals maximize their winnings. You must teach them the best strategies, ensure they understand the odds, and prevent them from getting overconfident and losing their hard-earned money. It's not just about the gold; it's about outsmarting the unseen forces at play. Keep your wits about you, trust your instincts, and remember – in the Wild West, things are rarely as they seem. Good luck, partner.
